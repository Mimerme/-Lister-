## About
Text a number, add a song to a playlist based on its lyrics or title, go to the website, and get the playlist!

This HackRU project was meant as a learning experience, integrating new apis such as Twilio, MongoDB, the Youtube API, and Linode.

## Structure
There is one central server which everything runs on, the website and the Twilio handler. Configuration is up to you as you'll need your Twilio credentials, a MongodDB server, and a Youtube API key.
